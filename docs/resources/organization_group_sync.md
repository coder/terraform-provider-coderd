# coderd_organization_group_sync (Resource)

Group sync settings for an organization on the Coder deployment. 
Multiple instances of this resource for a single organization will conflict.

~> **Warning**
This resource is only compatible with Coder version [2.16.0](https://github.com/coder/coder/releases/tag/v2.16.0) and later.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "coderd_organization_group_sync" "test" {
  organization_id     = coderd_organization.test.id
  field               = "groups"
  regex_filter        = "test_.*|admin_.*"
  auto_create_missing = false

  mapping = {
    "test_developers" = [coderd_group.test.id]
    "admin_users"     = [coderd_group.admins.id]
    "mixed_group"     = [coderd_group.test.id, coderd_group.admins.id]
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `field` (String) The claim field that specifies what groups a user should be in.
- `mapping` (Map of List of String) A map from OIDC group name to Coder group ID.
- `organization_id` (String) The ID of the organization to configure group sync for.

### Optional

- `auto_create_missing` (Boolean) Controls whether groups will be created if they are missing. Defaults to false.
- `regex_filter` (String) A regular expression that will be used to filter the groups returned by the OIDC provider. Any group not matched will be ignored.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# The ID supplied must be an organization UUID
$ terraform import coderd_organization_group_sync.main_group_sync <org-id>
```
Alternatively, in Terraform v1.5.0 and later, an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used:

```terraform
import {
  to = coderd_organization_group_sync.main_group_sync
  id = "<org-id>"
}
```
