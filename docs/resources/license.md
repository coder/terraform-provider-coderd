# coderd_license (Resource)

A license for a Coder deployment.

It's recommended to set [`create_before_destroy`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#create_before_destroy) on license resources. Without setting this, Terraform will remove the old license before adding the updated license. This will result in a temporary disruption to your users; during which they may be unable to use features that require a license.

Terraform does not guarantee this resource will be created before other resources or attributes that require a licensed deployment. The `depends_on` meta-argument is instead recommended.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "coderd_license" "license" {
  license = "<â€¦>"

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```
